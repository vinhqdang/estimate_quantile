# Project: Streaming Quantile Estimation

This project aims to explore and develop algorithms for estimating quantiles and other statistical values from streaming data.

## State-of-the-Art Review

- **KLL (Karnin, Lang, and Liberty):** Randomized algorithm, considered the state-of-the-art due to its low memory footprint and high accuracy.
- **Greenwald-Khanna (GK):** Deterministic algorithm that provides precision guarantees.

## Plan

1.  Implement a well-known algorithm (e.g., KLL or GK) as a baseline.
2.  Benchmark the implementation against known libraries or test data.
3.  Explore potential improvements or novel hybrid approaches.
