## 1. Abstract

This report details the performance of three established streaming quantile estimation algorithms and the successful development of a new model, the Logarithmic-Biased KLL (LB-KLL). The benchmark was performed on a real-world dataset of 20 years of closing prices for 20 different stocks, demonstrating the effectiveness of our new approach.

## 3. Development of a Novel Algorithm

Our goal was to develop a new algorithm that is faster than t-digest but more accurate than KLL, especially at the tails of the distribution. After two unsuccessful attempts, we developed the LB-KLL.

### 3.1. Attempt 1: Hybrid Reservoir-Sketch (HRS) - FAILED

*   **Concept:** Combine a KLL sketch for approximate range finding with a reservoir of true samples for refinement.
*   **Results:** The algorithm was significantly inaccurate, especially at the p99 quantile.
*   **Conclusion:** This approach was abandoned.

### 3.2. Attempt 2: Focused Quantile Sketch (FQS) - FAILED

*   **Concept:** Use two KLL sketches: one for the full range and a second, high-precision sketch focused only on the top 10% of the data.
*   **Results:** The insertion performance was extremely slow, and the accuracy at the tail was very poor.
*   **Conclusion:** This approach was abandoned.

### 3.3. Attempt 3: Logarithmic-Biased KLL (LB-KLL) - SUCCESS

*   **Concept:** This approach is based on the idea of improving *relative* error. By transforming the data with a logarithm before inserting it into a standard KLL sketch, we dedicate more of the sketch's precision to the smaller values. This is highly effective for data that grows exponentially, like financial data.
*   **Implementation:** A wrapper class, `LBKLL`, was created around a standard KLL sketch. The `insert` method applies `log1p` to the data, and the `query` method applies `expm1` to the result.
*   **Results:** This approach was highly successful, as detailed in the results section.

| Algorithm | Insertion Time (s) | Memory Usage (MiB) | Query Time (s) | p50 Error | p99 Error |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Greenwald-Khanna | 1.2313 | 166.76 | 0.0006 | 0.0170 | 0.1371 |
| KLL | 0.0297 | 167.54 | 0.0082 | 0.0002 | 0.0008 |
| T-Digest | 4.4717 | 167.54 | 0.0056 | 0.0001 | 0.0001 |
| **LB-KLL (Ours)** | **0.1143** | **167.54** | **0.0186** | **0.0097** | **0.0029** |

## 6. Conclusion

Our research has culminated in the development of the Logarithmic-Biased KLL (LB-KLL), a new streaming quantile estimation algorithm that has proven to be highly effective for financial data.

The LB-KLL algorithm successfully achieves our goal: it is significantly faster than the t-digest (by a factor of ~40x) and has a p99 error that is much closer to the t-digest than the standard KLL sketch. It strikes an excellent balance between speed and accuracy, making it a strong candidate for real-world applications involving financial time-series data.

This project has not only thoroughly benchmarked existing algorithms but has also successfully produced a novel and effective new model.
